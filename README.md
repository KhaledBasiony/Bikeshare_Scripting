# Bikeshare_Scripting

This is my submissions to the first Scripting Project with python from Udacity's Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree.

In this project we explore and analyze a Bikeshare program's data in Chicago, Washington, and New York through basic Command Line Interface.
you can filter data by city, month, or day, to view their summary statistics, most common routes, busiest times, and more!

If you want to try this on your machine, you would have to have python 3, panads, numpy, and matplotlib installed.
You can download or clone this repo, extract the zip file (make sure the .csv files are in the same directory as the .py file) and then run the file.

If you are currently trying to do the project from Udacity, feel free to check my solution, but please do not copy it :)
